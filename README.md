# ebnftools.py

This is a package for working with EBNF grammars written using the [W3
EBNF syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-notation). In particular,
emphasis is on manipulating grammars rather than generating parsers.

**WARNING**: This package is under heavy development and there are no
guarantees of backward compatibility. Use at your own risk.
