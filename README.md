# ebnftools.py

This is a package for working with EBNF grammars written using the W3
EBNF syntax. In particular, emphasis is on manipulating grammars
rather than generating parsers.

**WARNING**: This package is under heavy development and there are no
guarantees of backward compatibility. Use at your own risk.
